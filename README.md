# Statusight

Statuslight is a vim plugin that provides better looking statuslines in a simpler, but similar way to powerline. It was mainly built out of frustration that vim-powerline is no longer maintained and the new powerline is not easy to install or configure when it's only used with Vim.

## Status
Right now statuslight is very unflexible because it suits my specific needs but could be modified to be more flexible or even forked. Right now it's themed to be used with tomorrow-night but has decently configurable options.
